# Laptop Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This Python script demonstrates a machine learning pipeline for predicting laptop prices based on various features using a dataset named `laptop_data.csv`. The code performs data preprocessing, feature engineering, and applies a Linear Regression model to predict laptop prices.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The code begins by loading the dataset `laptop_data.csv` using Pandas and performs various preprocessing steps:
    - Extracting numerical values from columns like 'Ram', 'Weight', and 'ScreenResolution' to use them as features.
    - Handling categorical variables by creating dummy variables.
    - Feature engineering: Extracting screen resolution details, identifying if the laptop has a touchscreen, IPS display, etc.
    - Preparing features and target variable for machine learning.

2. **Model Training and Evaluation**: The script splits the dataset into training and testing sets, then creates a machine learning pipeline using scikit-learn:
    - ColumnTransformer for handling categorical variables.
    - Linear Regression model as the estimator.
    - Fitting the pipeline to the training data.
    - Predicting laptop prices using the test set.
    - Evaluating the model using R-squared score and Mean Absolute Error.

3. **Output**: The script prints the R-squared score and Mean Absolute Error, showcasing the model's predictive performance.

## File Structure

- `laptop_data.csv`: Dataset containing laptop information.
- `laptop_price_prediction.py`: Python script for predicting laptop prices.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have all the prerequisites installed.
2. Place the `laptop_data.csv` file in the same directory as the Python script.
3. Run the `laptop_price_prediction.py` script in your Python environment.

## Note

- **Data**: Ensure the dataset `laptop_data.csv` is correctly formatted and contains necessary information for the features and target variable ('Price').
- **Model Tuning**: Consider experimenting with different machine learning models, hyperparameters, or additional feature engineering techniques to potentially improve prediction accuracy.
